#IMDb Series Analysis and Rating Prediction: A Comprehensive Data Science Project
Project Description:

This project aims to demonstrate data science skills through the analysis of an IMDb dataset containing information about various TV series. The dataset includes series names, certificates, runtimes, genres, ratings, and votes. The project involves several key steps:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handling missing values
Standardizing data formats
Parsing genres
Converting categorical data into numerical formats
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Investigating the distribution of ratings and votes
Analyzing correlations between features
Exploring genre distributions and their popularity
Genre Analysis:

Identifying common genre combinations
Analyzing average ratings and votes for each genre
Understanding viewer preferences
Predictive Modeling:

Building machine learning models to predict series ratings based on features such as runtime, genre, certificate, and votes
Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics
Interactive Dashboard:

Creating an interactive dashboard to present key insights from the analysis
Allowing users to explore the data through dynamic visualizations and filters
Tools Used:

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
Jupyter Lab: For interactive coding and analysis
Git and GitHub: For version control and collaboration
Dash/Streamlit or Tableau/Power BI: For building interactive dashboards
This project showcases the ability to handle real-world data, perform in-depth analysis, build predictive models, and present findings in an accessible manner, proving job-readiness and a solution-oriented approach in data science.
